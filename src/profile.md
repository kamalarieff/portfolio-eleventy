  title: About me
---

I'm a full stack developer from Mudah.my mainly focusing on JavaScript language. React for frontend, Node.js for backend.

I'm usually on the computer most of the time coding and learning. When I'm not on the computer, I enjoy cycling.

I use VIM for coding and Emacs `org-mode` and `org-roam` for notetaking.

I am currently rocking a ZSA moonlander with Cherry MX Brown and Logitech MX Ergo for my peripherals.
